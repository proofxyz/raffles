The `participants` file will be shuffled and the draw performed by taking the
first 39 distinct addresses from the shuffled list. An address that appears more
than once therefore has a greater chance of winning, proportional to how many
times it is included, but can still only win a single piece. The prizes will be
allocated in decreasing order of their purchase price.
