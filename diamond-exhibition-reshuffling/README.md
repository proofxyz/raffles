# Diamond Exhibition reshuffling

Although not strictly a raffle, we include this code here for verification of
fair reallocation.

There are many possible optimal reshufflings with the same scoreâ€”thus we rely on
entropy out of our control to randomly search the space. We commit to the
(future) Ethereum mainnet block [17237600](https://etherscan.io/block/17237600),
and will use the block hash as the aforementioned entropy.
