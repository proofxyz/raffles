* 465 guaranteed spots have already been allocated to holders of full sets.
* All other holders receive one entry per piece held, minus one if they've been granted a guaranteed allocation.
* This raffle selects 1,035 allow-list spots + a further 500 wait-list places; delineated by the order in which the shuffler prints the addresses.
* If additional wait-list places are required, the number drawn will be increased as the shuffler guarantees that this simply appends to the list.
